        <p class="summary__text">
          A BMI range of 18.5 to 24.9 is considered a 'healthy weight.'
          Maintaining a healthy weight may lower your chances of experiencing
          health issues later on, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. Aim for a
          nutritious diet with reduced fat and sugar content, incorporating
          ample fruits and vegetables. Additionally, strive for regular physical
          activity, ideally about 30 minutes daily for five days a week.

            Although BMI is often a practical indicator of healthy weight, it is
            not suited for every person. Specific groups should carefully
            consider their BMI outcomes, and in certain cases, the measurement
            may not be beneficial to use.
